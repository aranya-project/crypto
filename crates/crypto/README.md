# `spideroak-crypto`

[![Docs][docs-img]][docs-link]

SpiderOak's cryptography library.

## Usage

This is a low-level cryptography library and can very easily be
misued. See usage-specific guidance below.

### Aranya Users

Unless you are implementing an `Engine`, you should use
[`aranya-crypto`] instead.

### SpiderOak Employees

Most projects have their own high-level cryptography APIs. Use
those instead.

## Security
